- HTML x CSS
- Javascript x Game Flow

1. HTML and CSS:

Create color panels/buttons on HTML then style them in CSS

Create START button to initialize game; maybe QUIT/PAUSE button for ending if you have time

Create CENTER CIRCLE to hold start/pause buttons and make it look authentic and as close to the real 80s toy.

Once basic style and format is completed, move on to the functionality of game.

2. JAVASCRIPT:

First step is to create variables (game pieces = quadrants and a sequence pattern to determine flow of game)

The sequence should become randomized so that the player may follow the pattern with every correct click.

GAME FLOW: Click event to initialize game by way of function (triggers sequence),
